      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Radhey-Shanti Foundation is a humanitarian non-profit initiative committed to transforming the lives of elderly individuals residing in old age homes by fostering self-sufficiency, dignity, and a renewed sense of purpose.</p>
      <p>Anchored in the timeless philosophy of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”—the world is one family—our work transcends mere caregiving. We strive to cultivate environments where the elderly are not only cared for but are meaningfully engaged, empowered, and celebrated.</p>
      <p>Through holistic approaches—vocational training, psychological support, creative enrichment, and wellness—we replace marginalization with pathways of autonomy and fulfillment.</p>
      <p>We envision aging as a stage of wisdom, contribution, and flourishing.</p>
