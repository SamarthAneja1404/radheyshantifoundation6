    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Radhey-Shanti Foundation is a humanitarian non-profit initiative committed to transforming the lives of elderly individuals residing in old age homes by fostering self-sufficiency, dignity, and a renewed sense of purpose.</p>
    <p>Anchored in the timeless philosophy of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”—the world is one family—our work transcends mere caregiving. We strive to cultivate environments where the elderly are not only cared for but are meaningfully engaged, empowered, and celebrated as vital members of society.</p>
    <p>Through a holistic approach that integrates vocational training, psychological support, creative enrichment, and wellness interventions, we seek to dismantle the marginalization of aging populations and replace it with pathways of autonomy and fulfillment.</p>
    <p>At Radhey-Shanti Foundation, we envision a society where aging is not equated with decline, but embraced as a stage of wisdom, contribution, and human flourishing.</p>
